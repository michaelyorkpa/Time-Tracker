- [x] Rename the main summary screen to "Dashboard" everywhere

## Version 0.22.2

- [x] Hours on reporting screen do not round when a client is not billable
- [x] If a client/project is marked as "Unbillable" in settings screen, allow a checkbox below "Rounding" heading that says "Round hours?"

## Version 0.22.5.0 - Frontend Utilities and Timer State Refactor

- [x] Refactor timer count changes so adding timers does not stop, reset, delete, or rebuild existing running timers
  - [x] Do not clear and rebuild the entire timer grid when the selected timer count changes
  - [x] When increasing the timer count, append only the newly needed timer cards and timer instances
  - [x] When decreasing the timer count, only remove timer cards above the new selected count
  - [x] If a removed timer has elapsed, paused, or running time, show an in-app confirmation modal before removing it
  - [x] Existing timers below the new selected count must keep their current client, project, description, billable flag, elapsed time, running/paused state, and status message
  - [x] Add a browser-console debug helper or unit-style sanity function that confirms:
    - [x] Existing timer object identities are preserved when adding timers
    - [x] Existing running timers remain running after adding timers
    - [x] Removed timers are disposed cleanly when confirmed

## Version 0.22.5.1

- [x] Convert warning pop-ups to in-app modal windows instead of browser `alert()` / `confirm()` dialogs
  - [x] Create a shared modal/confirm helper that can be reused across timer, client/project, user, settings, edit-entry, and future admin screens
  - [x] Use accessible markup:
    - [x] `role="dialog"`
    - [x] `aria-modal="true"`
    - [x] Focus moves into the modal when opened
    - [x] Escape key and Cancel button close the modal
    - [x] Focus returns to the triggering control when closed
  - [x] Keep the native `beforeunload` browser warning where required, because browsers restrict custom unload modals

## Version 0.22.5.2

- [x] Create shared frontend helper modules under `public/js/shared/` or similar
  - [x] `api-client.js`
    - Wrapper around `fetch()`
    - Handles JSON request/response boilerplate
    - Handles non-OK responses consistently
    - Provides `getJson()`, `postJson()`, `putJson()`, `deleteJson()` helpers
  - [x] `modal.js`
    - Shared in-app modal and confirmation helper
  - [x] `formatters.js`
    - Currency, hours, dates, names, and statuses
  - [x] `billing.js`
    - Shared billing and rounding calculations used by reporting and dashboard screens
  - [x] `records.js` or `matching.js`
    - Shared client/project matching helpers currently duplicated between reporting, dashboard, and edit-entry pages
  - [x] Keep this as plain browser JavaScript with no build step for now

## Version 0.23.0 - Client and Project CRUD Foundation

- [x] Replace whole-tree client/project saves with granular CRUD
  - Current risk:
    - The current client/project save path deletes and reinserts all clients/projects for an organization
    - That is acceptable for early app data, but it becomes dangerous once tasks, notes, tickets, roles, audit logs, API integrations, and external references point at client/project IDs
  - Goal:
    - [x] Client and project records should be created, updated, archived/deactivated, and deleted individually
    - [x] Existing IDs must be preserved
    - [x] Saving one project must not rewrite unrelated clients/projects
- [x] Add granular client endpoints
  - [x] `GET /api/clients`
  - [x] `POST /api/clients`
  - [x] `GET /api/clients/:clientId`
  - [x] `PUT /api/clients/:clientId`
  - [x] `DELETE /api/clients/:clientId` archive/deactivate equivalent
- [x] Add granular project endpoints
  - [x] `GET /api/projects`
  - [x] `GET /api/clients/:clientId/projects`
  - [x] `POST /api/clients/:clientId/projects`
  - [x] `GET /api/projects/:projectId`
  - [x] `PUT /api/projects/:projectId`
  - [x] `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId` archive/deactivate equivalent
- [x] Keep `GET /api/client-projects` as a compatibility/read endpoint for screens that still need the nested client/project tree
- [x] Retire or restrict `PUT /api/client-projects`
  - [x] Do not allow it to delete and reinsert all clients/projects long term
  - [x] If temporarily retained for compatibility, document it as deprecated
  - [x] Make sure it cannot break task/note/ticket/role references once those exist
- [x] Add repository methods instead of replace-all methods
  - [x] `clientsRepository.create()`
  - [x] `clientsRepository.update()`
  - [x] `clientsRepository.archive()` or `clientsRepository.delete()`
  - [x] `projectsRepository.create()`
  - [x] `projectsRepository.update()`
  - [x] `projectsRepository.archive()` or `projectsRepository.delete()`
- [x] Prefer archive/deactivate over hard delete for clients and projects
  - [x] Add `archived_at`, `deleted_at`, or consistent `status` behavior if needed
  - [x] Preserve old clients/projects for historic time entries, audit logs, notes, tickets, and tasks
- [x] Add or verify database constraints and indexes
  - [x] Clients remain scoped by `organization_id`
  - [x] Projects remain scoped by `organization_id` and linked to clients
  - [x] Add indexes for common lookups by organization, client, status, and updated date
- [x] Update client/project admin UI to use granular endpoints
  - [x] Creating a client calls the client create endpoint
  - [x] Editing a client calls the client update endpoint
  - [x] Creating a project calls the project create endpoint
  - [x] Editing a project calls the project update endpoint
  - [x] Archiving/deleting a client or project affects only that one record
- [x] Preserve denormalized time-entry names for historical reporting, but keep IDs stable
  - [x] Time entries may continue storing `client_name` and `project_name` as historical display values
  - [x] Future joins and links should rely on stable `client_id` and `project_id`

## Version 0.23.1 - Immediate UX and Documentation Cleanup

- [ ] Clean up small front-end issues before the workspace shift begins

  - [ ] Keep compatibility wrappers where old route names still exist
  - [ ] Do not change unrelated behavior while renaming
- [ ] Add a self-hosted configuration option for workspace availability
  - [ ] Allow self-hosted installs to limit workspace creation to business-only mode later
  - [ ] Default behavior should remain compatible with the current single-workspace install
- [ ] Run `npm run check`

## Version 0.24.1 - User Workspace Memberships and Active Workspace Sessions

- [ ] Separate users from direct workspace ownership/assignment
  - [ ] Create a `user_workspaces` table to track which users can access which workspaces
  - [ ] Preserve existing users by creating memberships for their current workspace during migration
  - [ ] Add role/status-ready fields where useful, but do not fully implement permissions in this version
- [ ] Add primary workspace ownership

  - [ ] Services call `auditService.record()` after successful create/update/delete/archive actions
  - [ ] Routes should not manually assemble audit rows unless there is no better service-layer location
  - [ ] Audit service should accept structured values and stringify JSON internally

  - [ ] `delete`
  - [ ] `archive`
  - [ ] `restore`
  - [ ] `login`
  - [ ] `logout`

  - [ ] Activity feed is for dashboard-friendly "latest updates"
  - [ ] The activity feed may use audit events as a source, but should not force the audit table to become a general UX feed forever
- [ ] Run `npm run check`

## Version 0.25.1 - Audit Log Settings

- [ ] Add audit log settings to Workspace Settings below billing settings
