# Longtail Forge
Plan the Project. Track the work. Preserve the knowledge.

## Background
Longtail Forge started off as a simple, flat file time tracker and has become a project hub for me. I feel like it can be useful for others as well, so I'm building it out with more functionality.

The name is derived from the Wired article, and later book, *The Long Tail* by Chris Anderson. The concept is that the big, obvious stuff is only part of the story. In business, a few popular products or projects get most of the attention, but there's a "long tail" of smaller, niche, less obvious things that collectively matter a lot.

Freelancers and small agencies (web design & development, graphics design, etc.) tend to fill the gaps left behind by larger agencies/companies. The big project is easy. It has a start, an end, and a clearly visualized middle. The long tail of that is the stuff that comes after the launch:

- Small fixes
- Support requests
- Maintenance Notes
- Weird, client-specific settings
- Old decisions nobody remembers (don't turn off that box, it connects the database server to the file server)
- Recurring tasks
- Tiny updates that keep everything running

### Why I built this tool

I couldn't find a good, all-in-one tool that met my needs for time tracking, reporting, tasks, notes, and project management that integrated together in a way I found useful.

    - [x] Each line should include: 
        - [x] Current date
        - [x] Hours recorded by the stop watch
        - [x] Client

    - [x] Each stop watch can be started, stopped, paused, and reset independently

- [x] Reporting
- [x] Client/project editing on the front end
- [x] Time editing on the front end
- [x] Manual time entry
- [x] Home Screen
    - [x] Active Clients 
        - Shows total number with drop down to go to clients reporting
    - [x] Table with current month's billables
        - Only shows clients with billables for the month
    - [x] Bar graph showing previous 12 months' hours and billables versus current month's hours and billables
        - Left side is total hours
