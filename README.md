# Longtail Forge
Plan the Project. Track the work. Preserve the knowledge.

## Background
Longtail Forge started off as a simple, flat file time tracker and has become a project hub for me. I feel like it can be useful for others as well, so I'm building it out with more funcitonality.

The name is derived from the Wired article, and later book, *The Long Tail* by Chris Andersen. The basic concept is that high volume purchases are good for large companies, but as large companies focus on high volume items, they create an increasing value for low volume things.

I couldn't find a good, all-in-one tool that met my needs for time tracking, reporting, tasks, notes and management that integrated together in a way I found useful. So, I built a tool to do it.
