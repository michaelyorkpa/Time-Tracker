# Longtail Forge

Plan the project. Track the work. Preserve the knowledge.

## Overview

Longtail Forge started as a simple time tracker and is growing into a small-project operations hub for freelancers, small agencies, and similar teams.

The app currently focuses on:

- Multi-timer time tracking
- Client and project management
- Billable and non-billable reporting
- Manual time entry and time-entry editing
- User login and administration
- Organization settings
- SQLite-backed local storage

## Background

The name is derived from the Wired article, and later book, *The Long Tail* by Chris Anderson. The concept is that the big, obvious work is only part of the story. In business, a few popular products or projects get most of the attention, but there is a long tail of smaller, niche, less obvious things that collectively matter a lot.

Freelancers and small agencies often fill the gaps left behind by larger agencies and companies. The big project is easy to recognize. It has a start, an end, and a clearly visualized middle. The long tail is the work that comes after launch:

- Small fixes
- Support requests
- Maintenance notes
- Client-specific settings
- Old decisions nobody remembers
- Recurring tasks
- Tiny updates that keep everything running

## Why I Built This Tool

I could not find a good, all-in-one tool that met my needs for time tracking, reporting, tasks, notes, and project management in a way that felt integrated and useful.

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Node.js 20 or newer
- npm
- SQLite command-line tool available as `sqlite3`, or set `SQLITE_COMMAND`

### Setup

Install dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

The app stores local runtime data in `data/`, including the SQLite database at `data/longtail-forge.db`. Database migrations run automatically when the server starts.

### Optional Environment Variables

- `HOST`: server host, defaults to `127.0.0.1`
- `PORT`: server port, defaults to `8001`
- `SQLITE_COMMAND`: SQLite executable, defaults to `sqlite3`
