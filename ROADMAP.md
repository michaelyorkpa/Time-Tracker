## Version 0.22.5.0 - Frontend Utilities and Timer State Refactor

- [x] Refactor timer count changes so adding timers does not stop, reset, delete, or rebuild existing running timers
  - [x] Do not clear and rebuild the entire timer grid when the selected timer count changes
  - [x] When increasing the timer count, append only the newly needed timer cards and timer instances
  - [x] When decreasing the timer count, only remove timer cards above the new selected count
  - [x] If a removed timer has elapsed, paused, or running time, show an in-app confirmation modal before removing it
  - [x] Existing timers below the new selected count must keep their current client, project, description, billable flag, elapsed time, running/paused state, and status message
  - [x] Add a browser-console debug helper or unit-style sanity function that confirms:
    - [x] Existing timer object identities are preserved when adding timers
    - [x] Existing running timers remain running after adding timers
    - [x] Removed timers are disposed cleanly when confirmed

## Version 0.22.5.1

- [x] Convert warning pop-ups to in-app modal windows instead of browser `alert()` / `confirm()` dialogs
  - [x] Create a shared modal/confirm helper that can be reused across timer, client/project, user, settings, edit-entry, and future admin screens
  - [x] Use accessible markup:
    - [x] `role="dialog"`
    - [x] `aria-modal="true"`
    - [x] Focus moves into the modal when opened
    - [x] Escape key and Cancel button close the modal
    - [x] Focus returns to the triggering control when closed
  - [x] Keep the native `beforeunload` browser warning where required, because browsers restrict custom unload modals

## Version 0.22.5.2

- [x] Create shared frontend helper modules under `public/js/shared/` or similar
  - [x] `api-client.js`
    - Wrapper around `fetch()`
    - Handles JSON request/response boilerplate
    - Handles non-OK responses consistently
    - Provides `getJson()`, `postJson()`, `putJson()`, `deleteJson()` helpers
  - [x] `modal.js`
    - Shared in-app modal and confirmation helper
  - [x] `formatters.js`
    - Currency, hours, dates, names, and statuses
  - [x] `billing.js`
    - Shared billing and rounding calculations used by reporting and dashboard screens
  - [x] `records.js` or `matching.js`
    - Shared client/project matching helpers currently duplicated between reporting, dashboard, and edit-entry pages
  - [x] Keep this as plain browser JavaScript with no build step for now

## Version 0.23.0 - Client and Project CRUD Foundation

- [ ] Replace whole-tree client/project saves with granular CRUD
  - Current risk:
    - The current client/project save path deletes and reinserts all clients/projects for an organization
    - That is acceptable for early app data, but it becomes dangerous once tasks, notes, tickets, roles, audit logs, API integrations, and external references point at client/project IDs
  - Goal:
    - Client and project records should be created, updated, archived/deactivated, and deleted individually
    - Existing IDs must be preserved
    - Saving one project must not rewrite unrelated clients/projects
- [ ] Add granular client endpoints
  - [ ] `GET /api/clients`
  - [ ] `POST /api/clients`
  - [ ] `GET /api/clients/:clientId`
  - [ ] `PUT /api/clients/:clientId`
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/clients/:clientId` or archive/deactivate equivalent
- [ ] Add granular project endpoints
  - [ ] `GET /api/projects`
  - [ ] `GET /api/clients/:clientId/projects`
  - [ ] `POST /api/clients/:clientId/projects`
  - [ ] `GET /api/projects/:projectId`
  - [ ] `PUT /api/projects/:projectId`
  - [ ] `DELETE /api/projects/:projectId` or archive/deactivate equivalent
- [ ] Keep `GET /api/client-projects` as a compatibility/read endpoint for screens that still need the nested client/project tree
- [ ] Retire or restrict `PUT /api/client-projects`
  - [ ] Do not allow it to delete and reinsert all clients/projects long term
  - [ ] If temporarily retained for compatibility, document it as deprecated
  - [ ] Make sure it cannot break task/note/ticket/role references once those exist
- [ ] Add repository methods instead of replace-all methods
  - [ ] `clientsRepository.create()`
  - [ ] `clientsRepository.update()`
  - [ ] `clientsRepository.archive()` or `clientsRepository.delete()`
  - [ ] `projectsRepository.create()`
  - [ ] `projectsRepository.update()`
  - [ ] `projectsRepository.archive()` or `projectsRepository.delete()`
- [ ] Prefer archive/deactivate over hard delete for clients and projects
  - [ ] Add `archived_at`, `deleted_at`, or consistent `status` behavior if needed
  - [ ] Preserve old clients/projects for historic time entries, audit logs, notes, tickets, and tasks
- [ ] Add or verify database constraints and indexes
  - [ ] Clients remain scoped by `organization_id`
  - [ ] Projects remain scoped by `organization_id` and linked to clients
  - [ ] Add indexes for common lookups by organization, client, status, and updated date
- [ ] Update client/project admin UI to use granular endpoints
  - [ ] Creating a client calls the client create endpoint
  - [ ] Editing a client calls the client update endpoint
  - [ ] Creating a project calls the project create endpoint
  - [ ] Editing a project calls the project update endpoint
  - [ ] Archiving/deleting a client or project affects only that one record
- [ ] Preserve denormalized time-entry names for historical reporting, but keep IDs stable
  - [ ] Time entries may continue storing `client_name` and `project_name` as historical display values
  - [ ] Future joins and links should rely on stable `client_id` and `project_id`

## Version 0.23.1 - Database Audit Logging

- [ ] Move audit logging to database
  - Server/error logging should still be written to files in the logs/ directory
  - Replace app-event CSV logging with a database-backed audit log for application-level changes
  - Treat audit logging as core app infrastructure, not as a time-tracking-specific feature
  - Include the following fields:
    - audit_id
    - organization_id (Foreign Key)
    - created_at
    - actor_user_id
    - actor_user_name <- On the front end, I want to make this clickable
    - action, change_type
    - record_type, record_id, record_label, record_url <- On the front end, I want to make this clickable
    - previous_value_json, new_value_json, metadata_json
- [ ] Create an `audit_logs` table
  - [ ] `audit_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY`
  - [ ] `organization_id TEXT NOT NULL`
  - [ ] `created_at TEXT NOT NULL`
  - [ ] `actor_user_id TEXT`
  - [ ] `actor_user_name TEXT`
  - [ ] `action TEXT NOT NULL`
  - [ ] `change_type TEXT NOT NULL`
  - [ ] `record_type TEXT NOT NULL`
  - [ ] `record_id TEXT`
  - [ ] `record_label TEXT`
  - [ ] `record_url TEXT`
  - [ ] `previous_value_json TEXT`
  - [ ] `new_value_json TEXT`
  - [ ] `metadata_json TEXT`
- [ ] Add audit-log indexes
  - [ ] `organization_id, created_at`
  - [ ] `organization_id, actor_user_id`
  - [ ] `organization_id, record_type`
  - [ ] `organization_id, change_type`
  - [ ] `organization_id, record_id`
- [ ] Create a shared `auditService.record()` function
  - [ ] Services call `auditService.record()` after successful create/update/delete/archive actions
  - [ ] Routes should not manually assemble audit rows unless there is no better service layer location
  - [ ] Audit service should accept structured values and stringify JSON internally
  - [ ] Audit service should gracefully handle null previous/new values for create/delete events
- [ ] Use consistent audit `change_type` values
  - [ ] `create`
  - [ ] `update`
  - [ ] `delete`
  - [ ] `archive`
  - [ ] `restore`
  - [ ] `login`
  - [ ] `logout`
  - [ ] `settings_change`
- [ ] Use consistent audit `record_type` values
  - [ ] `organization`
  - [ ] `organization_setting`
  - [ ] `user`
  - [ ] `client`
  - [ ] `project`
  - [ ] `time_entry`
  - [ ] Future:
    - [ ] `task`
    - [ ] `note`
    - [ ] `support_ticket`
    - [ ] `invoice`
    - [ ] `api_key`
- [ ] Add audit logging for current app records
  - [ ] Time entries:
    - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Delete when delete exists
  - [ ] Organization settings:
    - [ ] Update
  - [ ] Users:
    - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Username update
    - [ ] Password reset
    - [ ] Deactivate
    - [ ] Reactivate
    - [ ] Delete
  - [ ] Clients:
    - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Archive/delete
  - [ ] Projects:
    - [ ] Create
    - [ ] Update
    - [ ] Archive/delete
- [ ] Keep audit log and activity feed conceptually separate
  - [ ] Audit log is for admin/security/history/verification
  - [ ] Activity feed is for dashboard-friendly “latest updates”
  - [ ] The activity feed may use audit events as a source, but should not force the audit table to become a general UX feed forever

## Version 0.23.2 - Audit Log Settings

- [ ] Add audit log settings to Organization settings below billing settings
  - [ ] App audit logging checkbox (checked = on)
    - [ ] Log when audit logging is turned off and on
    - [ ] The act of turning audit logging off should still create an audit record before logging is disabled
    - [ ] The act of turning audit logging back on should create an audit record after logging is enabled
  - [ ] Retention period:
    - 7 days
    - 14 days
    - 30 days
    - 60 days
    - 90 days
    - 180 days
    - 1 year
  - [ ] Default logging period to 30 days
- [ ] Store audit settings in the database
  - [ ] Add fields to `organization_settings` or create a dedicated `organization_audit_settings` table
  - [ ] Recommended fields:
    - [ ] `audit_logging_enabled`
    - [ ] `audit_retention_days`
    - [ ] `audit_settings_updated_at`
- [ ] Add audit retention cleanup
  - [ ] Cleanup should be organization-scoped
  - [ ] Cleanup should respect each organization's configured retention period
  - [ ] Cleanup may run on app startup, on a scheduled/admin-triggered path, or before audit-log reads
  - [ ] Do not delete logs newer than the configured retention period

- [ ] Clicking on a user in the column view filters by user automatically
- [ ] Clicking on a record in the modal view takes admin to edit page for that record
- [ ] Full audit log export (CSV?)
- [ ] Filtered audit log export (CSV?)

## Version 0.24.0 - Roles and Permissions Foundation

  - [ ] Show only key prefix after creation

## Version 0.26.0 - Module-Ready Architecture

- [ ] Create module-ready backend structure
  - [ ] Goal is not full plugin install/uninstall yet
  - [ ] Goal is to prevent the app from becoming one giant time-tracker-shaped codebase before notes, tasks, support tickets, invoicing, and integrations are added
- [ ] Introduce a `src/core/` area for shared infrastructure
  - [ ] App creation/bootstrap
  - [ ] Database helpers
  - [ ] Migration runner
  - [ ] Auth/session helpers
  - [ ] Permission helpers
  - [ ] Audit service
  - [ ] API key auth
  - [ ] Shared AppError/error handling
- [ ] Introduce a `src/modules/` area
  - [ ] `src/modules/time-tracking/`
  - [ ] `src/modules/clients/` or `src/modules/client-projects/`
  - [ ] `src/modules/users/`
  - [ ] Future:
    - [ ] `src/modules/tasks/`
    - [ ] `src/modules/notes/`
    - [ ] `src/modules/support-tickets/`
    - [ ] `src/modules/invoicing/`
    - [ ] `src/modules/integrations/`
- [ ] Each module should be able to own:
  - [ ] Routes
  - [ ] Services
  - [ ] Repositories
  - [ ] Normalizers/validators
  - [ ] Migrations
  - [ ] Public/browser JS where appropriate
  - [ ] Protected views where appropriate
  - [ ] Seed/default data where appropriate
- [ ] Add a module registry
  - [ ] The app should know which modules exist
  - [ ] The app should know which modules are enabled for an organization
  - [ ] The registry can be simple at first, for example a static JavaScript module exporting module definitions
- [ ] Add database support for enabled modules
  - [ ] `modules` table or equivalent
  - [ ] `organization_modules` table or equivalent
  - [ ] Track enabled/disabled state per organization when the app supports organization-level modules
- [ ] Make migrations module-aware
  - [ ] Core migrations should still run first
  - [ ] Module migrations should run after core migrations
  - [ ] Migration checksums should continue to work
  - [ ] Applied migrations should record enough information to identify the owning module
- [ ] Move existing code gradually
  - [ ] Do not do a risky all-at-once restructure
  - [ ] Move time tracking into a module first
  - [ ] Move clients/projects into a module or shared domain module
  - [ ] Keep route behavior unchanged while moving files
  - [ ] Run `npm run check` after each move
- [ ] Prepare for installable modules later
  - [ ] Time-tracking/billing/invoicing module
  - [ ] Notes/knowledge base module
  - [ ] Support tickets module
  - [ ] Tasks module
  - [ ] Integrations module

  - [ ] Organization defaults
  - [ ] Client overrides
  - [ ] Project overrides
  - [ ] Billable/non-billable status
  - [ ] Round-hours setting for unbillable clients/projects
  - [ ] Billing periods

    - [ ] Description
    - [ ] Billable flag
